## Technologies Used:

## API:
  * The API used for this is the pledge API `https://developer.pledge.to/#api`
  * Note that to overcome CORS issues, the API calls are through a proxy 
  * If you are playing with the code on your local environment, you may need to 'enable' the proxy
  * Do so via `http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo` and clicking on the button to request temporary access.
